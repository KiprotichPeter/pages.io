        to Influencers, social media keeps growing as we move into the future. Influencers are people who have to build a reputation for their knowledge and expertise on a special 
        topic. For some time now, I have been so curious about someone can grow from zero to million followers. After some research, I found some open-source information about Instagram 
        influencers. For this research, I had to see if the number of followers, or Average likes or Total likes and the number of posts you post can affect your influencer score.</ul></font></center>
        <center><font size="+2"><p>Four common types of Influencers are:</p></font></center>
        <center><font size="+2"><li>Mega or celebrity influencers (1M+ followers)</li></font></center>
        <center><font size="+2"><li>Macro influencers (100K–1M followers)</li></font></center>
        <center><font size="+2"><li> Influencers (10K–100K followers)</li></font></center>

          <font size="+2"><p>Pyhton pandas libray was one of the librays I used when  I was analying and clearing the data. Some of the statistical data I was looking for were median, mode,average,
            maximum value, minimum value and correlation. For all the four graphs I found out that they had different Statistics. But the most important findings was that there was no
            significant correlation between influencer score and the variable I change above. I was not able to determine why is that, however I will try to find more about it.</p>
